        Hi, I'm Zitong (Samantha) Huang, a junior majoring in History with a minor in Information Technology & Management. 
        My interests lie in the fields of web development and human-computer interaction. Last year, I worked as an HR intern for Xiaomi Company, 
        which sparked my interest in IT. I enjoy reading books, free diving, and playing with miniature toys in my spare time:D
